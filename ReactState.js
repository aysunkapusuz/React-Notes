// 1)What is state in React?

// The data of an app at a given point in time
// This data will lead to what the user will see on their page
// State can change over time. So, the "state" of your app may vary
//For data(state) that changes over time, React gives you some ways for handling that and one way is with the useState function

//// You can use useState() hook to manage state within a React component
// Hooks must be called at the top of the component
// Hooks can not be called inside loops, conditions, nested functions.
