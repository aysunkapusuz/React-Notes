// What is React & Core Principles

// "A JS library(some pre-written code) for building user interfaces"

// 3 Principles of React via their docs


// 1)Declarative 

// You tell React what you want your page to look like
// what HTML it should render, and React will figure out // React will use JS to implement what you want it to look like
// How to create and render that HTML in the most optimal way
// This improves predictability and is easier to debug

// 2)Component-Based

// Build individual components (they are functions) that create part of your User Interface
// Logic is written in JS
// Re-use these components anywhere within your app
// Allows you break down complex apps into easy to create/use components

// 3) Learn Once, Write Anywhere

// React also works for mobile apps, on the server, and can be added to an existing teck stack

//React Features 
//JSX(It's a syntax looks like HTML but it is actually JS), Virtual DOM improving performance, one-way data flow(data can only flow from parent to child), strong community

//What to know before React
// HTML, CSS, JS.
